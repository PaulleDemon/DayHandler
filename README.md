# Remainder App

This is a simple example of a remainder application using pyqt framework. Using this application you can set a remainder and you will be notified about that event.

You can create Todo, Goals and projects to help you become more productive. 

All the icons were created using windows paint application except for the settings icon which was taken from [iconmonstr Icons](https://iconmonstr.com/?s=settings). 
You are free to use any icons I created without attribution except for the app icon(App icon shouldn't be used for commercial purposes).
